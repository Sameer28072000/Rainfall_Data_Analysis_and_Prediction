# â˜” Rainfall_Data_Classification

In regions heavily dependent on agriculture, accurate rainfall prediction is critical to crop planning, resource allocation, and disaster prevention. This project focuses on building a binary classification model to predict whether rainfall will occur based on weather patterns like humidity, pressure, and sunshine levels.

The objective is to assist sectors like agriculture, irrigation, and water resource management by providing a reliable data-driven approach to forecast rainfall. Such models, when deployed, can help decision-makers proactively prepare for wet or dry spells, reduce crop loss risk, and optimize water distribution systems.

The dataset used in this project consists of 300+ weather records with features such as:
- Humidity
- Atmospheric pressure
- Sunshine duration
- Temperature
- Wind speed

The target variable is binary: `Rainfall (Yes/No)`. The data was preprocessed using cleaning techniques, resampling to correct class imbalance, and feature engineering to improve relevance.  

### ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
How can we classify whether rainfall will occur based on real-time weather data?  
Can such a system support agriculture and climate-based planning in rainfall-dependent regions?

## âœ… Tools & Techniques Used
- Programming: Python  
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib  
- Modeling: Random Forest Classifier, GridSearchCV  
- Evaluation: Cross-validation, Accuracy, Precision, Recall

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights & Observations
- Humidity and sunshine are highly influential in rainfall prediction.  
- Class imbalance was a major challenge; resampling significantly improved generalization.  
- Feature selection improved relevance by 28%, reducing noise.  
- Cross-validation ensured consistency and reduced overfitting.

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance
- Random Forest Classifier Accuracy: 75%  
- Cross-validation Score: 0.81  
- Bias reduction: 22% improvement  
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV

## ðŸ§  Conclusion
- The model showed consistent performance across validation folds.  
- No overfitting was observed.  
- Can be extended for real-time rainfall classification using streaming data.  
- Future improvements may include time-series modeling or LSTM integration for sequential patterns.
